I am a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at **Instituto Superior Técnico** and the 
**Laboratory for Robotics and Engineering Systems (LARSyS)**, supervised by 
**Prof. Rodrigo Ventura** and **Dr. Meysam Basiri**.

My research focuses on developing autonomous UAV trajectory planning frameworks for 
efficient 3D reconstruction of dynamic and unknown environments — integrating perception, 
target tracking, and motion planning to improve aerial autonomy.

Previously, during my M.Sc. thesis within the AERO.NEXT Portugal agenda, I collaborated 
with Tekever to develop planning algorithms that improved reconstruction speed by 
**30–50%**, validated through real-world UAV experiments.
