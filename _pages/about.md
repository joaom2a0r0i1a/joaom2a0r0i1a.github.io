Hi! My name is **João Mendes**, and I am a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering 
at **Instituto Superior Técnico** and the **Laboratory for Robotics and Engineering Systems (LARSyS)**, 
supervised by **Prof. Rodrigo Ventura** and **Dr. Meysam Basiri**.

My research focuses on developing **autonomous motion-planning frameworks for UAVs** to enable efficient and reliable **3D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic environments**. I am particularly interested in integrating **next-best-view strategies, real-time mapping, target tracking,** and **autonomous exploration** to allow aerial robots to perceive and act intelligently in scenes where objects move, structures evolve, and uncertainty is unavoidable.

During my M.Sc. thesis with the AERO.NEXT Portugal agenda and Tekever, I developed UAV motion-planning algorithms for 3D reconstruction and validated them experimentally, achieving significant performance gains. However, this work also revealed a critical limitation shared by most state-of-the-art frameworks: they assume **static environments**. This gap directly motivated my PhD, where I now focus on extending reconstruction and planning techniques to **dynamic, uncertain, and evolving scenes.**

My current goal is to design a unified UAV planning framework capable of **actively reconstructing dynamic objects**, combining tracking-aware mapping and dynamic-object–aware NBV strategies within a real-time architecture suitable for deployment on real aerial platforms.
