## Tekever / Instituto Superior Técnico  
# Research Fellow
**Worked on the WP ARX research project, part of the AERO.NEXT Portugal agenda, in cooperation with Tekever, a European leader in maritime surveillance for Unmanned Aircraft Systems** (9/2023 – 12/2025)

- Integrated into a group of 10+ researchers, attending weekly meetings to explain the research developments with the Instituto Superior Técnico supervisors and quarterly meetings with Tekever, presenting the main research breakthroughs.
- Designed and developed comprehensive motion planning frameworks for 3D reconstruction of an environment using a single-drone and a multi-drone system, showing a 30% to 50% improvement in reconstruction speed compared to other state-of-the-art motion planning algorithms.
- Conducted **real-world UAV experiments** validating algorithm efficiency.
- Authored a research paper submitted to **IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)**.
